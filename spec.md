# Jabber

## Abstract

An on-chain messaging protocol that allows any kind of messages to be sent between crypto addresses. This document goes into some of the protocol spec for private chat, end-to-end encryption, PubSub and push notifications.

We also explore the technical design that allows sending and delivering messages on the Solana network with speed and low cost.

## Introduction

Public blockchains has popularized the use of self-sovereign identities, this is an improvement over centralized systems which lacks interoperability, privacy and security. Today the most popular applications making use of this is decentralized finance, with advancement in modern blockchain with speed and cost we could see growth in the broader web3 applications.

The shift from emails to crypto identities in web3 applications have made it hard for web3 applications to communicate with their users in a decentralized way. A PubSub between protocols and users would allow communication of important alerts like liquidations, DEX trades, governance, marketing etc.

We expect the protocol to be used in the same way emails are used today, for async communication, your public keys become the first point of contact for users and services in web3 ecosystem.

## Core components

1. Messaging protocol - The program and interface for on-chain messaging including 1-1 messages, PubSub and public groups.
2. Push notification nodes - A decentralized network of nodes that acts as a bridge between the blockchain and centralized systems for push notifications(browser/email/FCM/APNS/SMS etc).
3. Clients - Web UI, JS & mobile SDK's that gives a simple interface to developers for sending and receiving the on-chain messages.

## Specification

### 1. Thread

Threads stores info on the interaction between accounts. When two id's interact for the first time, the sender should create this thread account. Clients only need to subscribe to this account to get notified of any new message for the thread.

This is a derived account, if the thread account `create_account_with_seed(receiver_pk, sender_pk)[1]` exists, use it. Otherwise create the account by `create_account_with_seed(sender_pk, receiver_pk)[1]`. All thread accounts need to be rent exempted[2].

```
u1: Public key of user1.
u2: Public key of user2.
prev_thread_u1: The previous chat thread for user1.
prev_thread_u2: The previous chat thread for user2.
msg_index: Last index of message
meta: Array to record thread state like chat state indicators.
u1_ban: Indicates if user1 has banned this thread. This field can only be changed by user1.
u2_ban: Indicates if user2 has banned this thread. This field can only be changed by user2.
```

### 2. Message

Solana network is only used as a transport for messages. Messages need to be stored only for enough time for the push notification nodes or clients to receive the messages. This makes sending messages really cheap[3]. Storage rent for 3-6 days might be ideal(~$1 per 40k messages of 280 bytes), this can be altered based on live data.

This is a derived account, create by `create_account_with_seed(sender_pk, <message_index + receiver_pk>)` `message_index` - The `msg_index` + 1 from the Thread account.

Clients can query any message by deriving the message account from `msg_index` until 0.

```
data:  [required] The message data.
type:  [required] Kind of the message data. This field determines how the data field is intepreted. This field can be used to extend to additional message types.
meta:  [optional] Array of message meta data, this field can be used to append read receipts, reactions etc.
timestamp: [read-only] Unix timestamp set directly by the program
prev_msg: [optional] The public key of the parent message.
```

Message types:

```
0: Text message
1: CTA message
  title: Notification title
  body: The message body
  delivery: Timestamp to deliver the message. The push notification nodes should only send the notification after this time has passed.
2: Plain text message
  data: Message content
3: Encrypted message
  data: Encrypted message content
```

For simplicity, the Ed25519 signing key pair is converted into Curve25519\*. This means that by exchanging only 32-byte Ed25519 public keys users can both sign and encrypt without the clients having to manage custom RSA keys.

### 3. vCard

vCard is the identity system that is used. It works similar to a domain system, the program has the authority to delegate top level domain names. Jabber will use `.one` domains for user identity. It will be possible for anyone to create a namespace on this domain. The protocol will be able to understand any TLD as long as it adheres to the interface.

Account for `alice.one`:

```
public_key: [required] The user's public key
name: [optional]
bio: [optional]
website: [optional]
thread_tail_pk: The public key of the last chat thread
<key>: <value>
...
...
```

Clients can iterate through the linked thread list starting from `thread_tail_pk` to get the list of all chat threads. Clients should subscribe to this account to watch for new chat threads on `thread_tail_pk`.

### 4. PubSub

TBD

## Milestones

At this stage we are focusing on building the core protocol, GUI and clients for 1-1 messages. As the Solana ecosystem grows our goal is to become a communication infrastructure for all web3 applications with integrations like PubSub, public chat rooms.

With our first product release we hope to maximize the chat interactions and the push notifications enabled.

Current status:

- Messaging protocol - In progress(90%)
- vCard / identity - In progress
- JS client SDK - TBD
- Web GUI - TBD
- Push notification node - TBD

Future roadmap:

- PubSub channels
- Mobile apps
- Integrations like public chat rooms, feeds etc
- Programmable messages
